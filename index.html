                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>
                        During my work term, I contributed to the SmartVU project, a visual utility designed to simplify how operators interact with ADMS data. SmartVU provides intuitive tools to view, manage, edit, and share real-time system information. My role involved developing automated testing solutions that integrate into the build pipelines, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the software with every update.

                                I believe I achieved this goal, as I now feel confident writing effective automated tests and working with testing frameworks. Through hands-on experience with the SmartVU project and continuous integration pipelines, I gained a solid understanding of how automated testing ensures software reliability and quality.

                                I'm proud to have achieved my goal of contributing effectively in a team environment. By communicating technical ideas clearly and seeking regular feedback, I was able to build strong working relationships and ensure alignment across the team. The positive feedback from colleagues and the success of our collaborative efforts reflects the value of clear, inclusive communication.

                                Throughout my work term, I became much more familiar with real-world software development practices, including version control, committing code, creating pull requests, and reviewing changes. I also gained hands-on experience with build processes and CI/CD pipelines, which helped me understand how code moves from development to production. This exposure improved my problem-solving skills by teaching me how to work within a structured workflow, identify issues early, and contribute more effectively to team deliverables.

                        My work term at Survalent Technology has been an incredibly valuable learning experience. I had the opportunity to strengthen my technical skills, especially in automated testing, software development processes, and team collaboration. Working on real-world projects like SmartVU gave me a deeper understanding of how large-scale utility systems operate and the importance of quality and reliability in critical infrastructure software. I’m grateful for the guidance and support of my team, and I leave this term with greater confidence in my abilities and a clearer sense of direction in my career as a developer.
